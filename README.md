                    }

                    ".footer a" {  // can invoke css selector to be evaluated as locator
                        hasText = "Getting started" // can directly set locator options
                        // returns the locator to be able to chain or store locator in a variable
                    }.click {
                        button = MouseButton.LEFT // can directly set click options
                        // returns the clicked locator to be able to chain further
                    }

                    screenshot {
                        // can directly set screenshot options

                    }

                    // can use xpath to be evaluated as locator and return a list of locators
                    val allFooterLinkLocators =
                        "//footer//a" {}.all() // can use xpath to be evaluated as locator and return a list of locators

                    // return all footer links
                    allFooterLinkLocators.map { it.textContent() to it.getAttribute("href") }
                }
